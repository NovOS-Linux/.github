<h1>NovOS ISOS & their source code are no longer maintained by the team as of September 1st, 2023!</h1>
<p>NovOS will still be supported until January 2024. However, New ISO's & source code updates are no longer officially supported. Our ISO's will be still available for as long as possible!</p>

<h1>Important management updates</h1>
<p>Starting January 1st 2024, I (Novus) will be stepping down as the maintainer & developer of NovOS & (the upcoming) NovOS FE. I do not have the time or resources to maintain 2 Linux distros at the same time. I will be focusing more on blizOS which is another Arch based distro i made. My friend Cole (colebolebole) will be taking over the project around the same time i step down. This will have no impact on blizOS and possibly NovOS FE. It's been a nice time running this project since the beginning in Summer 2021. Thank's for all the memories. I won't forget about NovOS.</p>
